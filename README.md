# PHP Vulnerability Detector

Small project I wrote for a secure software development class in university. The Project is a website that will take php files and use the phpstan tool to detect vulnerabilities. These are subsiqently added as comments in the php file. The file can then be downloaded again with the added comments.

The main focus of this project was the authentication to the pages. Oauth was used for login with Redis storing and keeping track of the session tokens.
